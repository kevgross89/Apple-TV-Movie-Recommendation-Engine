One way they think they can attract more subscribers is by increasing the amount of movies they offer on their platform. Apple TV+ would like to explore the use of recommendation engines when selecting movies to include on their platform with the end goal being to attract more subscribers. Additionally, they can use the movie recommendation engine to expertly suggest movies to watch for all of its customer's needs.
